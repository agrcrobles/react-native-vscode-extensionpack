# React Native Extension Pack

A collection of my popular extensions that can help write, test and debug React Native applications in Visual Studio Code.

## Extensions Included

### React Native Tools

This extension provides a development environment for React Native projects. Using this extension, you can debug your code, quickly run `react-native` commands from the command palette, and use IntelliSense to browse objects, functions and parameters for React Native APIs.

### Flow

You may not need flow but React Native codebase uses it as the static type checker. This extension adds Flow support for VS Code.

* For more about it [see here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode)

### Prettier

Format your JavaScript and TypeScript using Prettier.

### ESLint

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.
