A collection of my favorite extensions for working with React Native Applications in VS Code

### VS Code ESLint extension

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.
